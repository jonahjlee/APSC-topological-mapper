# APSC-topological-mapper
Convert an image of a color-coded topological map to a CSV file of heights

This program was developed to allow z-axis (height) data to be automatically generated from x and y coordinates.

Module 7 of APSC provides an image of a topological map with different colours for different heights; these colours and heights are hard-coded into the python script.

With default settings, the output CSV contains a 121x121 grid of height values, where each height is the lower bound on the topological map.
